Darius II (Dual Screen) Free Play Hack
======================================
This is a quick and scrappy Free Play hack that makes Darius II playable without coins.

Features:
* 1P or 2P may start at any time
* Continue functionality works, and respects DIP setting
* Credit counts are not printed, interstitial Push Start screen is skipped
* The original coin-up sound is played once at the start of the game intentionally.
* The game has been modified to have English introduction text, but still say "Darius II" on the title.

Region may be set in the code fairly easily, as I have annotated it.
